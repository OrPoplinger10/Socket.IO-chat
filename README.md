# Socket.io-chat

In this project I built a chat that allows correspondence between people from different computers, 
I built this chat with the help of socket.io. 
The users can choose a nickname, and a color for their message to be of their choice, 
they connect to the chat, and can start writing.

Languages I used:

Server side - Node.js, Client side - React, Typescript.

Libraries I used: Socket.IO
